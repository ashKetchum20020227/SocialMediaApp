# Social Media App

This was my first MERN stack project. This was created with the help of Lamadev (Youtube). It was the stepping stone for me to create my own project (Fakemazon) individually.

## Functionalities

1) User Registration and Login.
2) Share a post with followers with image and description.
3) User Profile Page.
4) Like on a post.
5) Chat with friends.

## Description
